Personal Project - I have made a " Vacation With Tushar ", it has multiple cities, and users can see the description of the city, vacation cost, etc. Right now I am planning to learn more and work on another project but in the future, I am planning to make this BIG. 


UPDATES I WOULD LOVE TO DO IN THE FUTURE: 
1] Add the " I'm Interested " button too, which will help the user to book the vacation.
2] Make the layout responsive.
3] Add discount offers and run advertisements.
